## 📂 Folder Breakdown

### 1. `actions/`
Contains **Server Actions**. These are asynchronous functions that run on the server, used to handle form submissions and data mutations (POST, PUT, DELETE) without creating manual API routes.

### 2. `app/`
The core of the **Next.js App Router**.
* **`(auth)/` & `(main)/`**: Route Groups that organize pages logically without affecting the URL path.
* **`_components/`**: Private folders for components used strictly within a specific route, keeping them separated from the global component library.
* **`page.tsx` & `layout.tsx`**: Define the UI and shared wrappers for specific routes.

### 3. `assets/`
Storage for static files such as images, icons, and logos that are imported directly into React components.

### 4. `components/`
A library of shared, reusable UI pieces.
* **`ui/`**: Atomic components (Buttons, Inputs, Modals).
* **`common/`**: Shared structural elements like Navbars, Footers, or Sidebars.
* **`layouts/`**: Higher-order components used to wrap content in specific design patterns.

### 5. `constants/`
A central "dictionary" for immutable values. This includes static routes, API endpoints, and configuration limits to avoid "magic strings".

### 6. `hooks/`
Contains **Custom React Hooks**. This extracts reusable stateful logic (e.g., `useAuth`) so it can be shared across multiple components.

### 7. `lib/`
Dedicated to **Infrastructure and Third-party configurations**. This is where you initialize database clients, Redis instances, or utility functions.

#### JSDoc
/**
 * Fetches data from a specific resource endpoint.
 * ***@param*** {string} id - The unique identifier for the resource.
 * ***@returns*** {Promise<ApiResponse>} A promise that resolves to the formatted API response.
 * ***@throws*** {Error} If the network request fails or returns a 5xx status.
 
*/
**export async function fetchData(id, options) { ... }**

### 8. `services/`
The **Business Logic** layer. These functions handle communication with the **backend**.

#### JSDoc
/**
 * Fetches data from a specific resource endpoint.
 * ***@param*** {string} id - The unique identifier for the resource.
 * ***@returns*** {Promise<ApiResponse>} A promise that resolves to the formatted API response.
 * ***@throws*** {Error} If the network request fails or returns a 5xx status.
 
*/
**export async function fetchData(id, options) { ... }**


### 9. `types/`
Centralizes all **TypeScript Definitions**. It stores interfaces and types used throughout the app, ensuring data consistency and a "single source of truth".
